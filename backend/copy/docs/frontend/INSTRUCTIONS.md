# AI Protocols: Frontend Development

Whenever you (the AI Agent) are tasked with working in this directory (React Admin Panel), you must follow these protocols:

## 1. Contextual Awareness
- Theme: **Frontend (React, TypeScript, Vite)**.
- Design: Maintain the **Deep Ocean Glass** aesthetic (translucency, blurs, cyan/emerald accents).
- Interaction: Use `sonner` for toasts and `lucide-react` for icons.

## 2. Documentation Hygiene
- **Improve the documentation**: Update `docs/frontend/` files (e.g., `STRUCTURE.md`, `COMPONENTS.md`) after creating new features.
- Any new API call must be registered in `@/services/api.ts` with proper TypeScript interfaces.

## 3. Experience & Memory (Brain Dump)
- Record your session in `docs/brain/FRONTEND_BRAIN.md`.
- Append entries documenting how you solved UI/UX challenges or integrated complex API flows.
